## Singly Linked List

In a singly linked list each node in the list stores the contents of a node and a pointer or reference to the next node in the list.

## Doubly Linked List

This consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains two fields, called links, that are references to the previous and to the next node in a sequence of nodes.

## Stack

Last in first out

## Queue

First in first out

## Bubble Sort

For each element in the list, look at the element and the one to the right. If the left > right, swap them. Keep swapping until the end of the array. Then move to the next element in the array and repeat this.
